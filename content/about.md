*Hello there! I am a Research Scholar at [SSSIHL](https://www.sssihl.edu.in/).I love digging into Distributed Computing and the cool world of Web3 tech. I like to code stuff and tinker with Linux. Rust is my current conquest, with dreams of conquering Android realms in Kotlin. I follow F1 and rooting for Aston Martin. Join me on this rollercoaster; where I share my thoughts and opinions among many other things...*
